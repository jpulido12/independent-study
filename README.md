## Repository for "Exploring Stereotype Mismatches Using the N400 ERP Component" 

Hello! My name is Joemari Pulido and this repository holds all source files for my Independent Study: "Exploring Stereotype Mismatches using the N400 ERP Component". This study is advised my by mentor Dr. Joanna Morris and I am also receiving course credit for Psy490. My independent study will utilize approaches from cognitive neuroscience and paradigms commonly used in psycholinguistics to study social cognition. The approaches from cognitive neuroscience include electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). Paradigms the present study will borrow from psycholinguistics are the lexical decision task and masked priming paradigms. The present study aims to determine whether mismatches within gender and racially stereotypical associated word pairs and sentences will elicit the N400 effect. I hypothesize that word pairs and sentences that mismatch racial and gender stereotypes (ex: White:Criminal; Woman:Engineer) will lead to a N400 effect, conversely, word pairs and sentences that match racial and gender stereotypes (ex:Black:Criminal; Man:Engineer) will not lead to a N400 effect.
