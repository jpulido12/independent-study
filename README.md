This repository holds all files related to my Independent Study: "Exploring Stereotype Mismatches using the N400 ERP Component". My independent study will utilize approaches from cognitive neuroscience and paradigms commonly used in psycholinguistics. The approaches from cognitive neuroscience include electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). Paradigms the present study will borrow from psycholinguistics are the lexical decision task and masked priming paradigms. The present study aims to determine whether mismatches within gender and racially stereotypical associated word pairs and sentences will elicit the N400 effect. I hypothesize that word pairs and sentences that mismatch racial and gender stereotypes (ex: White:Criminal; Woman:Engineer) will lead to a N400 effect, conversely, word pairs and sentences that match racial and gender stereotypes (ex:Black:Criminal; Man:Engineer) will not lead to a N400 effect.
